# Simple Weather Dashboard

## Project Description

Weather plays a big role in determining travel plans. Thus, the goal of this project is to build an application that helps a traveler view the weather for multiple cities. This application will complete this task by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a server-side weather API to retrieve current weather information. 

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
```
